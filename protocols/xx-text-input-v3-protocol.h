/**
 * @page page_xx_text_input_unstable_v3 The xx_text_input_unstable_v3 protocol
 * Protocol for composing text
 *
 * @section page_desc_xx_text_input_unstable_v3 Description
 *
 * This protocol allows compositors to act as input methods and to send text
 * to applications. A text input object is used to manage state of what are
 * typically text entry fields in the application.
 *
 * This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
 * "should", "may", etc.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
 * backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
 * may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
 * Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
 * the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
 * Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'xx' prefix and the
 * version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
 * interface version number is reset.
